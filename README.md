* React Draggable
* Axios
* Webpack
* Babel
* SASS
* Yarn/NPM
* Rails 5 API Server

1. Download the zipped file

3. Run `npm start` or `yarn start`
4. Browse `http://localhost:3000`

## Usage

Pretty much like every user story board that any agile team uses and works with, we all know how important it is to communicate our ideas and processes amongst team members when building new features in our products for our clients. They have traditionally been captured/written on post-it-notes, therefore we always put them up on the wallboard for everyone to see.

I thought it would be an interesting and fun project to come up with my own user story board app that any person can create and attach post it notes on the wallboard.  You can even drag them around the board too!

Have fun!
